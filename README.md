# Automatic_door
The goal of this project is to design and build an automatic door system using an Arduino microcontroller. The door opens automatically when the ultrasonic sensor detects a person standing within 0.05 m of the door. A visual indicator (LED) switches ON when the sensor detects a person at 0.15 m and remains illuminated until the door closes.
